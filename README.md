The latest information regarding a fitness center franchise named, 'Model Fitness' is developing a customer engagement strategy based on analytical data. One of the most common problems encountered by fitness center services, and even other services is customer turnover or customer churn. How do we know when a customer has stopped using our service? We could indeed calculate the churn rate, based on the number of people who delete accounts or do not renew their subscriptions. But sometimes, could not know for sure, whether a client has actually quit: they may have left us without our knowledge. Churn indicators could vary from one field to another. If a user makes purchases from an online store on an irregular but regular basis, we could not say that the user has left our store. However, if for two weeks a user does not open an online shop channel which is updated daily, then could worry is sometimes indeed: the followers may get bored and decide to leave us. For fitness center businesses, it will be considered a customer to leave if they do not return for one month. In fact, it is not necessarily true. A customer may not visit the fitness center for a month because he or she is on vacation, for example to Bali, and will return to visit the fitness center after his or her vacation is over. However, cases like this are rare. Usually if a customer decides to join, then comes a few times and then disappears, the chances are that customer will not come back. This study is to reduce the churn rate, 'Model Fitness' has digitized a number of its customer profiles. This project is to analyze the profiles of these customers and develop customer retention strategies (customer retention). | _pandas_ _numpy_ _matplotlib.pyplot_ _seaborn_ _spearmanr_ _train_test_split_ _StandardScaler_ _LogisticRegression_ _RandomForestClassifier_ _KMeans_ : _dendrogram_, _linkage_ _accuracy_score_, _precision_score_, _recall_score_ _warnings_ |
