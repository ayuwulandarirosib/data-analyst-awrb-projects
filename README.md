## Features ✨
> Whenever we do an analysis, 
> we need to formulate some hypotheses that we need to test further.
> Sometimes, the tests we do lead us to accept the hypothesis,
> other times we also need to reject it.
> To make the right decisions in business, 
> we must understand whether 
> the assumptions we make are correct or not.

## Introduction
In this project, we will compare the music preferences of users in the cities of 'Springfield' and 'Shelbyville'. We will study the actual Y.Music data to test the hypotheses below and compare the users behavior in these two cities.

## Goal
In this Y.Music project, we will test three hypotheses, namely:
1. User activity varies depending on the day and city.
2. On Monday mornings, the residents of 'Springfield' and 'Shelbyville' tune into different genres. This also applies on Friday nights.
3. Listeners in 'Springfield' and 'Shelbyville' have different preferences. In 'Springfield', the users prefer to pop music, while in 'Shelbyville' the rap music has more fans.

## Stages
There are several steps to complete this project, namely:
1. Data Overview (Step 1. Downloading Database and Loading The Data)
In this stage, we will download and load the dataset from the following file path:

    '/datasets/music_project_en.csv'

    Here are the data descriptions of the file path above:
- 'userID' — user id
- 'Track' — track title
- 'artist' — artist name
- 'genre' — music genres
- 'City' — the city where the user is located
- 'time' — the length of time the song is played
- 'Day' — the day of the week

2. Data Pre-processing (Step 2. Exploring and Rectifying the Data)
In this stage, there are several things that need to be our focus, namely:

- Title Writing Style
- Missing Values
- Data Duplicates

3. Hypotheses Test (Step 3. Performing The Hypotheses Testing)
In this stage, we will perform the following Hypotheses Testing, namely:
- User activity varies depending on the day and city.
- On Monday mornings, the residents of 'Springfield' and 'Shelbyville' tune into different genres. This also applies on Friday nights.
- Listeners in 'Springfield' and 'Shelbyville' have different preferences. In 'Springfield', the users prefer to pop music, while in 'Shelbyville' the rap music has more fans.

4. Presentation (Step 4. Presenting My Project to The Viewers)
In this stage, I will present for my Project Presentation related to Music Preferences among 'Springfield' and 'Shelbyville' analysis.

5. General Conclusions (Step 5. Formulating General Conclusions)
In this stage, we will draw the whole of general conclusions.
