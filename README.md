## Features ✨
> The dataset contains data on purchases,
> made at the building-material retailer Home World.

## Introduction
All of its customers have membership cards. Moreover, they could become members of the store's loyalty program for $20 per month. The program includes discounts, information on special offers, and gifts.

## Goal
Therefore, we are going to take in deep in delving dataset materials in this project analysis. Accordingly, we have to define for the Project background.

First, the customer is everyone who purchases at the building-material retailer Home World and they have membership cards. In this way, the project manager responsible for the loyalty program.

Second, the targets of this information analysis are they who intended user of the final result. They are who the clients and retailers of the building-material Home World. Specifically the customers who initiated the projects.

Third, the customers could become members of the store's loyalty program for $20 per month. The program includes discounts, information on special offers, and gifts.

Fourth, this project is made to purpose for long term period or the entire period, so the development have to experiencing an upward movement. Indeed, we use the already datasets for our project making analysis.

Fifth, the presentation intended for the clients and retailers. Moreover for the customers, in case by easy presentation which is easier to understand by the customers.

Sixth, following the introduction of the loyalty program, it's important to understand whether it has actually led to the expected growth in average purchase size and number of items in the cart. This study will tell us how effective the program is.

Seventh, this is new and fresh research. Our solution for developing the business growth with the aim of all parties benefiting each other.

## Stages
There are several steps to complete this project, namely:
1. Data Pre-processing (Step 1. Downloading and Loading The Data)
In this stage, we will load and read datasets from the following file path:

    _'/datasets/retail_dataset_us.csv'_
    _'/datasets/product_codes_us.csv'_

    Here are the data descriptions of the files path above:

    a. retail_dataset_us.csv contains:
    - purchaseId
    - item_ID
    - purchasedate
    - Quantity — the number of items in the purchase
    - CustomerID
    - loyalty_program — whether the customer is a member of the loyalty program
    - ShopID

    b. product_codes_us.csv contains:
    - productID
    - price_per_one

2. Explorative Data Analysis (EDA) (Step 2. Performing Several Focus Things to be Analyzed)
In this stage, there are several things that need to be our focus, namely:
    1. Description of Analyzing The Loyalty Program Approach
    2. Description of Calculating Average Purchase Size Method
    3. Analyzing The Loyalty Program
        - Analyzing of the changes in average purchase size for each cohort for loyalty program members/non-members
        - Analyzing the purchase frequency for loyalty program members/non-members

3. Hypothesis Testing (Step 3. Doing Tests on The Hypothesis)
In this stage, we will do the tests on the Hypothesis.
    1. Formulating and Testing Statistical Hypotheses
        - Testing the hypothesis that the average purchase size is higher for loyalty program members than non-members
        - Formulating a statistical hypothesis regarding the data from the dataset and test

4. The Use of Metrics and Indicators Business (Step 4. Metrics and Indicators Business)
In this stage, we will do the Metrics and Indicators Business.


5. Dashboard (Step 5. Dashboard Construction)
In this stage, we will create the Dashboard Construction for visualization on Tableau Public.


6. Presentation (Step 6. Preparing The Presentation)
In this stage, we will prepare for the presentation of the project.


7. General Conclusions and Recommendations (Step 7. Formulating General Conclusions and Recommendations for Working with Clients)
In this stage, we will draw the conclusions and formulate recommendations.
