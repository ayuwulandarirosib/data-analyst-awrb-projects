## Features ✨
> We are going to prepare a report for the credit division of a bank.
> We will find out the effect of a customer's marital status
> and the number of children they have
> on the probability of default in repaying the loan.
> The bank already has some data
> regarding the creditworthiness of customers.

## Introduction
This report will be taken into consideration when making credit assessments for prospective customers. Credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of potential borrowers to repay their loans.

## Goal
In this project we will analyze several concerns, those are: 
1. Is there any relationships among having children and the probability of a person defaulting on a loan?
2. Is there any relationships among marital status and the probability of a person defaulting on a loan?
3. Is there any relationships among the level of income and the probability of a person defaulting on a loan?
4. How do different loan objectives affect a person's probability of defaulting on a loan?

## Stages
There are several steps to complete this project, namely:
1. Data Pre-processing (Step 1. Downloading and Loading The Data)
In this stage, we will download and load the dataset from the following file path:

    /datasets/credit_scoring_eng.csv

    Here are the data descriptions of the file path above that contains:
- 'children' - the number of children in the family
- 'days_employed' - how long the customers has been working
- 'dob_years' - customers age
- 'education' - customers education level
- 'educationid' - identifier for the customers' education level
- 'family_status' - customers' marital status
- 'family_status_id' - identifier for the customer's marital status
- 'gender' - customers gender
- 'income_type' - type of customers income
- 'debt' - Have the customers ever defaulted on a loan?
- 'total_income' - monthly income
- 'purpose' - reasons for taking out a loan

2. Data Processing (Step 2. Processing and Exploring the Data)
In this stage, we will process and explore the data by reading and capturing its point of views.

3. Data Transformation (Step 3. Digging The Certain Information through Data Transformation)
In this stage, we will digg the certain informations by taking a look at each columns to see what cases they might have.

4. Explorative Data Analysis (EDA) (Step 4. Performing Several Focus Things to be Analyzed)
In this stage, there are several things that need to be our focus, namely:
- Is there any relationships among having children and the probability of a person defaulting on a loan?
- Is there any relationships among marital status and the probability of a person defaulting on a loan?
- Is there any relationships among the level of income and the probability of a person defaulting on a loan?
-  How do different the loan objectives affect a person's probability of defaulting on a loan?

5. Presentation (Step 5. Presenting My Project to The Viewers)
In this stage, we will prepare for the presentation of the project.

6. General Conclusions (Step 6. Formulating General Conclusions)
In this stage, we will draw and formulate the conclusions.
