    "    1. The missing values in the 'total_income' and 'days_employed' columns are symmetrical, namely 2174 rows (10.099884% of the data). It is possible that this could be a system error.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. The 'days_employed' column contains many ambiguous values, where there are negative values. The length of service should not be negative, then the number of working days is unreasonable 340266 days / 365 days = 932 years. Then, we need to make modifications that make more sense by changing negative values to positive and the number of working days do not make sense adjusted to the age of the customers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. The education column has a unique value which differs in the style of writing in capital letters, lowercase letters, and so forth.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. The 'dob_years' column which is '0' is corrected by taking the youngest age in the data, that is 19 years old.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. The missing values of 'total_income' column is fixed by taking the median value, as well as the 'days_employed' column. The median value is considered more appropriate because the value in that column varies greatly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6. The 'education' column and the 'purpose' column are the data that are manually inputted, then they have many duplicate values and they have already corrected.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    7. In general, the data has many cases, ranging from 10.099884% of missing data, columns that have a lot of ambiguity and do not make sense, so there is a lot of manipulation of the data to fix the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    8. Based on the results of data analysis:\n",
    "        - Having children has no significant effect on debt repayment defaults.\n",
    "        - Furthermore, people who are married / never married have a lower % probability of default than those who are not married.\n",
    "        - In point of fact, rich people with large incomes do not guarantee success in paying on time where the data shows that their group has a 50% probability of defaulting on debt even though the data contains only two people.\n",
    "        - For the purpose of taking on debt, it has an effect of up to 9.36%, namely for those whose purpose is to buy a car and education.\n",
